# task_management_system
Task management system using django and django rest framework.

Task management system, built with django and django rest framework(backend).
User can be manager, developer or designer. And if user is manager s/he can
create projects, create tasks related to projects and assign them to aother user.
Currently I am working on front end using reactJS and trying to improve this backend.
